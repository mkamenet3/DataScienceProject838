# Stage 5 - Insights

The goal of this project is to do some data analysis on the integrated and
cleaned table, to infer insights. 


## Details

The goal is to create:

- a CSV file storing Table E, the integrated table which is the output of project stage 4. 
- a pdf file that discusses the following issues: 
  - Statistics on Table E: specifically, what is the schema of Table E, how many tuples are in Table E? Give at least four sample tuples from Table E. 
  - What was the data analysis task that you wanted to do? (Example: we wanted to know if we can use the rest of the attributes to accurately predict the value of the attribute loan\_repaid.) For that task, describe in detail the data analysis process that you went through. 
  - Give any accuracy numbers that you have obtained (such as precision and recall for your classification scheme).  
  - What did you learn/conclude from your data analysis? Were there any problems with the analysis process and with the data? 

If you have more time, what would you propose you can do next? 


## What's in the folder

We follow the format of the previous stage:

- **DATA** directory: contains csv (first 100) of the final integreated Table
  E (from stage 4).
- **CODE** diretory: contains a jupyter notebook that goes through the analysis


Due to the size of the data, in the **DATA** directory, we only present the
first 100 observations. The full data set can be found on our website
