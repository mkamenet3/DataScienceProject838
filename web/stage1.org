** Summary
In this stage of the project, we define the data science problem and
aquire the relevant data from sources. 
** Problem
For our project, we will analyze trends from movie databases to
predict which movies will be successful. In addition to features
provided by the datasets, we will attempt to extract information from
movie reviews that may assist with performance of prediction.

In addition, we aim to gain insights on:

1. Time trends of movie genres
  - by movie gross
  - by Facebook likes
2. Time trends of movie reviews
  - by reviews
3. Which genre groupings are most likely to be together (cluster analysis)

** Data
We aquired two datasets in table format (film.csv and
movie_metadata.csv) and a text data of movie reviews in html
format. There are common attributes among the three data sources, such
as title, year, and director, and many more shared by the table
datasets, although the formatting is not consistent. Each data source
has key attributes that we believe will help in prediction (see table
below).

*** Data extraction
- Text Data Extraction [[http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~younghoon/projects/cs838group/stage1/code/extract.html][(link)]]: 
  - The text data in its raw form consist of about 27,000 html files, with
    multiple reviews per movie and per reviewer. In order to select the
    reviews that are relevant to the movies in our table data, we plan
    to select a subset by matching the movie titles (and randomly
    selecting around 300). For now, we provided a Python script to parse
    the HTML file for the title, year, reviewer, and review content.
