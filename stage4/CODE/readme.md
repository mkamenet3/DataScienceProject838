# Stage4 - CODE

This folder contains the notebook **cs838stage4.ipynb** and python file **stage4_merge.py**.

- **cs838stage4.ipynb**: starts where stage 3 left off. Uses the matcher developed in stage 3 (logreg) and predicts on all tuple pairs in candidate set, C
- **stage4_merge.py**: creates schema for Table E (matches between table A and table B, including those predicted matches) and performs the merging of the two tables into one table.
