# CS838(Data Science Principles)-Project
This is the repo for our Data Science 838 course. Detailed information about
the project and progress by stage can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/cs838datascienceprojectmovie/)

## Project Goals and Scope
The focus of our project will be to gain insights into movies and trends. We
will extract data from two movie databases. The first one we take from Kaggle
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). The second
data source can be found
[here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets) 

Our main research question focuses on our ability to predict the *imdb_score*
from our *movies_metadata.csv* dataset. We will use the variables in this
datast in conjunction with the *film.csv* dataset. We will also attempt to
improve our results by exploring some basic sentiment analysis on our final
model. 


### Data Extraction and Cleaning

Code to perform our data cleaning and merging can be found in the ```ETL``` folder,
where the readme details our process.
