# DataScienceProject838
This is the repo for our Data Science 838 course

##Project Goals and Scope
The focus of our project will be to gain insights into movies and trends. We
will extract data from two movie databases. The first one we take from Kaggle
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). The second
data source can be found
[here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets) 

We aim to gain insights on:
- 1) Time trends of movie genres
  - by Facebook likes
- 2) Time trends of movie reviews
  - by reviews (sentiment analysis)
- 3) Which genre groupings are most likely to be together (cluster analysis)


###Data Extraction and Cleaning

Code to perform our data cleaning and merging can be found i the *ETL* folder,
where the readme details our process.
