# ETL

This folder contains code for cleaning and merging our datasets

- clean.py: clean movie_metadata.csv
- clean2.py: clean film.csv

## Notes on the data
- variables regarding movie gross or budgets are not all standardized to USD.
  Additionally, these amounts do not acccount for inflation. We therefore do
not use these.
